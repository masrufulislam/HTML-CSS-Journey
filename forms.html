            Using index.php is a convention that provides consistency across projects
            But it can anything action="index.php": The URL where the form data will be sent upon submission. 
            It can be any valid URL, like submit-form.php, https://example.com/submit, etc. 
            If no action is specified, the form will submit to the current page URL.

            The GET method appends form data to the URL, making it suitable for non-sensitive data and retrieval actions, 
            while the POST method sends data in the request body, ideal for sensitive information and modifying server-side data.
